# BrowDoge

A browser for Windows XP. It's based on Mypal68 which is based on Firefox 68.

**WARNING**

This browser does *not* run well on winxp SP2 and lower, like Mypal does. If you do not want to install SP3, be ready for crashes and blue screens.
If you are on SP2 and lower, there is no need to post a screenshot from blue_screen_view. And i suggest to apply postready updates of 2019.
Some say that it runs fine on sp2 but it is no accurate data what to do.

**IF YOU GOT A BLUE SCREEN**

Don't post a screenshot of the blue screen, as the screen isn't useful for troubleshooting.
For more data look at [#3](https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal68/issues/3) on the Mypal repo, and please do not make new duplicate reports.
Sudden restart may also be this error. It depends on the settings.

**IF YOU GOT A CRASH BUT WITHOUT BLUE SCREEN**

Describe detailed how to reproduces the crash, do not forget to put the link.
Do not post pictures of the crash, this is useless and a waste.
If i don't reproduce the crash myself then you may to submit drwatson.log.
Drwatson.log is usually inside All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Dr Watson.
Minidump also may be usefull. Do not post any irrelevent logs.

**IF YOU WANT REPORT A SITE**

Won't work for browdoge. But report that site on this [issue](https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal68/issues/228) for Mypal68.
Put the actual link to the site, btw.
Notice that the creator would never look to a site which requires a login, including any goolag sites.
Please try to find what feature is missing by yourself.
Then, report like for site 'x' is missing feature 'y'.

**YOU MAY DONATE**

But only by crypto! Does not go to me. [Look here](https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal68/issues/84).
